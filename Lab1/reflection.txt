Reflection on Lab 1

In this lab, I simulated an interaction experience between a host and its pet dog. The dog/mobile phone will respond to the words from me, of which the light color on the screen is used as an indicator of its mood. 

Light color and its dynamic change can deliver a variety of information to the players. However, limited by the solo, I chose a relatively easy scenario to perform. Though it is still difficult for me to control the color using mouse, act and move the dog at the same time. Probably next time I will ask friends to help with me.
